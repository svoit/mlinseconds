### I. Hello Xor (Week 1 / 2)

Hello Xor is a HellowWorld of Machine Learning.
In this problem you asked to design and learn neural network in such way, that it would be able to learn Xor function.
The function table for Xor function is:

 * 00 => 0
 * 01 => 1
 * 10 => 1
 * 11 => 0
 
Steps limit: 10.0

### Solution:
[helloXor.py](../master/mlis/problems/helloXor.py)
```
Test rate (max/mean/min/limit) = 1.000/1.000/1.000/1.000
Average steps = 5.300
Average time = 0.005/2.000
Average size = 41.000/100.000
```

### II. General CPU (Week 3)

In General CPU problem you are asked to learn a random function with n [4-7] parameters.

Steps limit: 10.0

### Solution:
[generalCpu.py](../master/mlis/problems/generalCpu.py)
```
Test rate (max/mean/min/limit) = 1.000/1.000/1.000/1.000
Average steps = 6.900
Average time = 0.025/2.000
Average size = 8471.000/10000.000
``` 

### III. Find Me (Week 4)

In Find Me problem you are asked to learn a random function with 8 inputs, but there are up to 32 random input added and you donâ€™t know which input is good inputs and which is random inputs. Generated data splited in 2 equal parts, first one used for training, second one used for testing.

Time limit: 2.0 seconds

### Solution:
[findMe.py](../master/mlis/problems/findMe.py)
```
Test rate (max/mean/min/limit) = 1.000/1.000/1.000/1.000
Average steps = 740.600
Average time = 0.850/2.000
Average size = 2843.000/1000000.000
```
